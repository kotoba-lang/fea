(ns kotoba.fea.resonance
  "Resonance-separation evidence for the `:vibration-fatigue-and-safety`
  design domain: turn a structure's natural frequencies (from
  `kotoba.fea.modal/solve-modal`) and the driveline's rotating excitation
  lines into an auditable separation ratio, then apply a caller-supplied
  no-resonance exclusion band as an acceptance check.

  This is the executable counterpart to the goal `kotoba.fea.modal`
  already declares in its own docstring — that natural frequencies let the
  designer \"separate motor excitation lines from structural resonance
  before committing geometry\" — which on the landed plane had no contract
  that actually does the separating. A beam/plate modal solve returns
  `:frequencies-hz`; a motor at `:rev-s` rotations-per-second excites the
  structure at harmonics `n x rev-s` (integer `n`). Nothing in the repo
  compared the two, so a designer could not yet ask the auditable question
  \"is any driveline harmonic sitting on (or unacceptably close to) a
  structural natural frequency?\" — this contract is that question, made
  executable.

  What this namespace does, by composition only:

    f-order       = n x :rev-s                    (exact identity, per order)
    sep-exc,nat   = |f-exc - f-nat| / f-nat        (relative separation of one
                                                   excitation line to its
                                                   nearest natural frequency)
    risk          = sep-exc < :min-separation-frac (caller-supplied band)

  Rules enforced here, matching the repo's fail-closed discipline:

  - No Mg/MgH2, PEM, thermal, fatigue, or performance constant is invented.
    `engine-harmonics-hz` is a pure identity over caller-supplied `:rev-s`
    and integer harmonic `orders`; the exclusion band is a caller decision
    that MUST carry `:provenance` (`{:source ...}` minimum) or the
    acceptance call refuses (same rule as `kotoba.fea.fatigue/curve` and
    `kotoba.fea.postprocess/factor-of-safety`). A band without provenance
    would let an unsourced margin silently pass for a measured/spec'd one.
  - Unknown measurements stay unmeasured: `:rev-s`, the orders present, and
    the natural frequencies are all caller measurements; this namespace only
    divides and compares them, it never estimates a constant.
  - Fails closed with typed ex-info (types shown in each fn's docstring and
    in the tests): non-positive `:rev-s`, empty/non-integer/zero orders,
    non-finite or non-positive natural/excitation frequencies, an empty
    natural sequence, or an exclusion band missing `:provenance` / with
    `:min-separation-frac` outside [0, 1) all throw.

  Units: `:rev-s` [rotations/s], natural and excitation frequencies [Hz],
  `:min-separation-frac` dimensionless [0, 1).

  100% pure/portable `.cljc`, no I/O, matching this repo's domain-namespace
  convention."
